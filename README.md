# Features of COVID Encyclopedia
- Display of confirmed, recovered and deceased patients across all states of India
- Choropleth map visualization of the impact of COVID across India which gives an idea of the COVID hotspots of India
- Display of risk (both a quantitative estimate and qualitative) of COVID for touring across India (district-wise).
- Forecasting the risk for touring in the near future using Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (India district-wise).
- Display of the nearest vaccination centers using your location on the selected date
- Displays various details like Hospital name, working hours, address, type of vaccine, age limit, availability etc

# Future Ideas
- Bringing in detection of COVID positive patients nearby using Bluetooth
- Social distancing warning by detecting distance
- Symptoms warning, collection and detection of COVID of user and suggesting precautions and medication
- Display lockdown rules, mask mandates and other precausion in the location of the user
